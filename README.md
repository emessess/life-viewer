  Probably overkill, but I'm used to it and haven't used many smaller generators.

To Run: 
  npm run start-dev
  open browser to localhost:8080

Report: 
  Spent a lot of time setting up backend, so the views are very incomplete. Should have probably scoped better for that and been more mvp about models and api.

  Redux also took up a lot of time. I have a strong preference for react-redux but again for this challenge I should have scoped accordingly and planned to deal with state directly on my React components.

  Plan would be to use a cards-style layout for the All Organisms view with name and image. Clicking through to single view would show all images, as well as full taxonomy. 

  Additional client routes and api query for each individual taxonomic category could give restful search views. Or a button system to sort the init store array, but that could get expensive.
